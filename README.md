# NLP
This repository contains implementation of Deep learning based **Language Models** from scratch. Including:
* [RNN](./RNN)
* [LSTM](./LSTM)
* [Transformer](./Transformer)
* [GPT](./GPT)


## Neural language modeling
Neural language modeling involves using neural networks to model the probability distribution of the words in a sequence. 
* **CLM** - Causal Language Modelling: Unidirectional next token prediction, Used to generate fluent texts.
* **MLM** - Masked Language Modelling: Masked tokens prediction, Used to learn good representations.

# Getting Started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/girishdhegde/NLP.git
cd RNN or LSTM or Transformer or GPT
```
Refer respective README.md in subdirectories for more details.
